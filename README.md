Simplistic DNS query tool.
Really a Rust exercise.

(
* install rust nightly build: ````./install-rust.sh````

OR

* use/install rust stable

)

2. run a dummy test: ````cargo test````
3. try out the program: ````cargo run reaktor.com````
4. build the executable: ````cargo build --release````
5. then try out the executable: ````target/release/kelaa reaktor.co.jp````

###### *Note:*

 Most recent version works with rust stable toolchan as well.
